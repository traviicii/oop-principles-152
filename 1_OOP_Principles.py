# OOP Principles

#-- Abstraction : Focusing on the "what" and not the "how"
#-- Polymorphism : When objects from different classes respond similarly to the same method in their own unique way
#-- Inheritance : Extending a parent class, giving it additional functionality and characteristics through subclasses
#-- Encapsulation : Bundling data and methods within a class, controlling access to them
